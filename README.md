# Binary-Search-Tree

## Technical details:
- implementation of BinarySearchTree with generic ```Nodes<type>```
    - methods: Insert , TryInsert, Search, Remove, RemoveSubtree, GetJson
- implementation of Balanced BinrySearchTree (DSW Algorithm) based on BinarySearchTree algorithm with some additivies like: CreateBackbone(), LeftRotate(), RightRotate()
- creation of timing test to compare mean execution time of creating regular generic list, Binary Search Tree and Balanced one
Program return .csv  file with outputs times.
