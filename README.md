# Binary-Search-Tree

## Technical details:
- implementation of BinarySearchTree with generic ```Node<type>```
    - methods: 
        - Insert, 
        - TryInsert, 
        - Search, 
        - Remove, 
        - RemoveSubtree, 
        - ```GetJson()```
- implementation of Balanced BinarySearchTree (DSW) based on BinarySearchTree algorithm with some additivies like: CreateBackbone(), LeftRotate(), RightRotate()
- creation of timing test to compare mean execution time of creating regular generic list, Binary Search Tree and Balanced one
Program return .csv  file with outputs times.
